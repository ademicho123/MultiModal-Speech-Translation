Used for the STT, TTS and TTT translation

1. Speech-to-Text Model (STT)
Enhance Accuracy & Robustness
Train with more diverse datasets covering different accents, dialects, and background noise.
Use domain adaptation techniques like transfer learning to improve performance on specialized datasets.
Explore self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT.
Real-time Performance Optimization
Optimize model architecture using quantization and pruning to reduce latency.
Implement streaming ASR methods to transcribe speech as it is spoken.
Reduce reliance on large models by using distillation techniques to create lightweight versions.
Data Augmentation
Use speed perturbation, noise injection, pitch shifting, and synthetic speech generation to improve generalization.
Generate adversarial examples to test model robustness.
Multilingual Support
Expand training data to include multilingual speech datasets (e.g., Common Voice, VoxForge).
Train a single model using multilingual speech embeddings (e.g., XLSR for Wav2Vec).
Domain-Specific Adaptation
Fine-tune models on industry-specific datasets (e.g., medical, legal, customer support).
Implement custom language models (LMs) to enhance transcription accuracy in niche fields.
2. Text-to-Text Translation Model
Fine-Tuning for Low-Resource Languages
Use back-translation to generate more training data.
Implement transfer learning by leveraging high-resource languages for low-resource language improvements.
Context Awareness
Improve sentence-level and document-level translation using transformers like mBART, mT5, or GPT-4.
Implement a context window mechanism to retain prior sentences' meaning.
Style & Formality Control
Train models to recognize and generate translations in different tones (e.g., casual vs. professional).
Allow users to specify translation tone preferences.
Error Analysis & Bias Mitigation
Use explainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify common translation errors.
Implement post-editing models to correct errors in translation outputs.
Custom Vocabulary & Named Entity Handling
Improve named entity recognition (NER) to preserve proper names, brand names, and technical terms.
Implement user-defined glossary support to ensure key terms are translated correctly.
